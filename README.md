# Passive Walker Algorithm

This software is a genetic algorithm written in Python that finds a possible solution for the passive walker problem.  
This problem consists in finding the best size, width and angle for the legs, so that the walker can complete the path. All those attributes are calculated by using an implementation of crossover, mutation and artificial selection.
